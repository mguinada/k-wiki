# k-wiki

An LLM-maintained knowledge wiki, derived from a human-owned Obsidian vault.

`k-wiki` implements the [Karpathy-style LLM wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) pattern: a personal Obsidian vault remains the human-owned source of truth. Notes marked `wiki: true` are deterministically synced into an immutable `raw/` projection inside this repo; an LLM agent then builds and maintains a structured, interlinked wiki under `wiki/`. The wiki is disposable derived data — versioned in git, auditable by diff, and publishable to all devices as a read-only mirror.

## Core invariant

```text
Human → source vault
Sync  → raw/
LLM   → wiki/
```

Never let that direction reverse.

## Status

Specification and planning stage. The current artifacts are the implementation guide and the Stage 1 roadmap; code lands sequentially through the [Stage 1 epic (#2)](https://github.com/mguinada/k-wiki/issues/2).

## In this repository

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `making-of/karpathy_obsidian_wiki_implementation_guide.md` | The implementation guide — spec of record, including the target repository layout (§6) |
| `AGENTS.md` / `wiki/AGENTS.md` | The two agent contexts (planned — [issue #3](https://github.com/mguinada/k-wiki/issues/3)) |

## Working in this repo (humans and agents)

This repository hosts two agent contexts with deliberately different permissions:

- **Wiki operations** (ingest, lint, query) follow `wiki/AGENTS.md`.
- **Pipeline development** (scripts, config, tests) follows the root `AGENTS.md`.

See [Two Agent Contexts](making-of/karpathy_obsidian_wiki_implementation_guide.md#1-two-agent-contexts) in the guide before doing either.
