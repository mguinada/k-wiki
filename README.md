# k-wiki

An LLM-maintained knowledge wiki, derived from a human-owned Obsidian vault.

`k-wiki` implements the [Karpathy-style LLM wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) pattern: a personal Obsidian vault remains the human-owned source of truth. Notes marked `wiki: true` are deterministically synced into an immutable `raw/` projection inside this repo; an LLM agent then builds and maintains a structured, interlinked wiki under `wiki/`. The wiki is disposable derived data — versioned in git, auditable by diff, and publishable to all devices as a read-only mirror.

## Core invariant

```text
Human → source vault
Sync  → raw/
LLM   → wiki/
```

Never let that direction reverse.

## Status

Stage 1 implementation is underway; code lands sequentially through the [Stage 1 epic (#2)](https://github.com/mguinada/k-wiki/issues/2).

## In this repository

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `making-of/karpathy_obsidian_wiki_implementation_guide.md` | The implementation guide — spec of record, including the target repository layout (§6) |
| `AGENTS.md` / `wiki/AGENTS.md` | The two agent contexts (planned — [issue #3](https://github.com/mguinada/k-wiki/issues/3)) |

## Working in this repo (humans and agents)

This repository hosts two agent contexts with deliberately different permissions:

- **Wiki operations** (ingest, lint, query) follow `wiki/AGENTS.md`.
- **Pipeline development** (scripts, config, tests) follows the root `AGENTS.md`.

See [Two Agent Contexts](making-of/karpathy_obsidian_wiki_implementation_guide.md#1-two-agent-contexts) in the guide before doing either.

## Tooling

The pipeline is TypeScript on Node.js (ESM). Node ≥ 22.18 runs the `.ts`
sources directly, so there is no build step — install dependencies with
`npm install` and run the commands below.

| Command | Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run typecheck` | tsc | Type-check `src/` and `tests/` without emitting code |
| `npm run lint` | Biome | Lint and verify formatting across the repo |
| `npm run format` | Biome | Rewrite files to the canonical format — the fix command for lint findings, not a gate |
| `npm test` | vitest | Run the unit test suite |
| `npm run fixtures -- <dir>` | fixture generator | Write the synthetic Obsidian test vault to `<dir>/Documents` |

Type check, lint, and unit tests are quality gates: every change passes
them before it is done. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) enforces the same
three gates on every pull request, testing each PR's merge commit against
`main`.

The fixture generator produces a deterministic fake vault — fixed bytes,
no timestamps — covering every case the sync layer must handle (selected,
excluded, edited, deleted, and noise files). A checked-in snapshot lives at
`tests/fixtures/Documents/`; regenerate it with
`npm run fixtures -- tests/fixtures` after changing the generator. Never
edit the snapshot by hand.
